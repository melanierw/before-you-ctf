| Problem Text (to be displayed to the user):
You have found the administrative control panel for the Daedalus 
Coperation Website: <a href='#'>http://something.com</a>. Unfortunately, 
it requires that you be logged in. Can you find a way to convince the 
web site that you are, in fact, logged in?

| Problem Name:
Delicious!

| Solution (full write-up):
This is a session hikacking problem. When you visit the site, you are 
assigned session number 67 via a cookie. The site uses this session 
number to determine whether you are logged in already. While you are not 
logged in, the users with session numbers 21-66 are all still logged in. 
Thus, by altering your cookie to be within 21 and 67, you will appear to 
the system to be oe of the users who is already logged in. Since you 
appear to be logged in, the site gives you the flag.

| Follow-up Text (Optional text to be displayed after user solves the challenge. Links to real world examples, lessons learned, etc.):
Session keys stored in cookies should not be guessable, otherwise users 
can hijack the sessions of other users.
